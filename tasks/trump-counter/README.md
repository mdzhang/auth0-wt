# Trump Counter

A silly webtask that when run, counts the number of times "Trump" appears on the front page of the NYTimes.

So if you go to your webtask url e.g. <https://wt-6ec7da55967198680c3c4c81f880ab0c-0.run.webtask.io/trump-counter>, you should see something like:

```
{
  2017-04-19 9:30:00 pm: 9,
}
```

Meaning that, when the task ran against the NYT at 9:30, it saw 9 instances of "Trump" on the webpage.
